# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (2026-09-29)
- CI: the validation step refused the padded source strings the build has
  emitted on purpose since 2026-09-08, so `main` and `version-15` had failed on
  every push. It now fails only on a padded key that has no stripped twin.

### Added (2026-09-29)
- `PRIVACY.md`, for the Frappe Cloud Marketplace listing.

### Added (2026-06-12 version-16 support)
- **Version-specific translation sets** under
  `translations/{app}/version-16/` (ja.po + ja.csv) for all five PO apps,
  seeded from the develop set via `msgmerge` against each app's `version-16`
  POT (`version-16-hotfix` for `lending`, which has no `version-16` branch).
  v16-specific gaps (frappe 48, erpnext 67, hrms 40) were AI-filled and
  flagged `#, fuzzy`; healthcare and lending needed no new strings.
- `deploy.sh --version <name>` — prefer `translations/{app}/<name>/ja.csv`,
  falling back to the develop-tracking CSV per app.
- `config.json` v2.1.0: `apps.{app}.versions` maps local version directories
  to upstream branches.
- `translate-all.sh` and `sync-csv.sh` now automatically cover
  `translations/{app}/version-*/ja.po` alongside the develop set.

### Changed (2026-06-12 upstream refresh)
- Refreshed `ja.po` for all five Crowdin-managed apps against the upstream
  POTs as of 2026-06-12 via `msgmerge --no-fuzzy-matching` (preserves
  existing translations and fuzzy flags, drops 253 obsolete strings).
  New strings translated: frappe 136, erpnext 785, hrms 35, lending 8
  (healthcare unchanged). AI-filled entries are flagged `#, fuzzy`; nine
  complex multi-line HTML/Jinja entries were translated manually.
- Regenerated the deployable `ja.csv` for the same apps via
  `scripts/sync-csv.sh`. Coverage is now 100 % across all five PO apps.
- README refresh procedure now uses `msgmerge` instead of `csv-to-po.py`:
  the CSV round-trip cannot carry fuzzy flags, so rebuilding PO from CSV
  would silently promote AI suggestions to approved translations.

### Added
- **PO-format translation files** (`translations/{app}/ja.po`) for the five
  Crowdin-managed apps: `frappe`, `erpnext`, `hrms`, `healthcare`, `lending`.
  PO is now the source of truth (matches upstream POT and Crowdin); CSV is
  regenerated from PO for bench deploy.
- **Refreshed `translations/{app}/ja.csv`** for the same five apps, derived
  from the new PO files. The deployable CSV picks up the AI-assisted coverage
  (≈ 99.9 %) so `scripts/deploy.sh` and `scripts/setup-locale.sh` carry the
  full Japanese surface to the bench, not just the legacy 15 - 80 %.
- `scripts/csv-to-po.py` — converts legacy `ja.csv` into gettext PO using the
  upstream `main.pot` as the authoritative source of msgids; applies glossary
  auto-fill on exact matches; emits a sub-POT of untranslated entries.
- `scripts/translate-po.py` — AI-fill empty `msgstr` via Gemini 2.5 Flash
  (default) or Anthropic Claude. Strict validation of placeholders, Jinja,
  newlines, Japanese bracket balance, and surrounding whitespace. All AI
  output is flagged `#, fuzzy` for proofreader review.
- `scripts/fixup-po.py` — post-pass that pads dropped leading/trailing
  whitespace in legacy translations and runs an AI strip-translate-reattach
  cycle for whitespace-bearing entries that the strict validator would
  otherwise reject.
- `scripts/translate-all.sh` — orchestrates `translate-po.py` over all
  Crowdin-managed apps.
- `scripts/po-to-csv.py` + `scripts/sync-csv.sh` — sync ja.po back into the
  Frappe legacy CSV shape consumed by the existing bench deploy scripts.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.

### Changed
- `config.json` bumped to **v2.0.0**:
  - explicit `format` (`po` | `csv`) and `crowdin` (boolean) per app,
  - added `defaults.pot_root` for the upstream POT mirror location,
  - clarified app types (core / community).
- `README.md` rewritten around the **PO + Crowdin** workflow as the primary
  contribution path; legacy CSV / bench-deploy path is documented as the
  parallel track for `posawesome` and local-only forks.

### Removed
- `hospitality` app entry from `config.json` — its upstream repository
  (`aakvatech/Hotel-Management`) is no longer reachable (HTTP 404). The
  historical `translations/hospitality/ja.csv` is preserved in git history;
  the directory may be removed in a future release.

### Coverage snapshot (2026-05-01)

| App | Source strings | Coverage | AI-fuzzy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| frappe | 6,143 | 99.9% | 5,213 |
| erpnext | 9,350 | 100% | 5,981 |
| hrms | 2,216 | 100% | 1,982 |
| healthcare | 1,947 | 100% | 1,549 |
| lending | 967 | 100% | 198 |
| **TOTAL** | **20,623** | **99.9%** | **14,923** |

Eleven entries (long HTML / Jinja Print Format help blocks) remain untranslated;
they are left for human review on Crowdin. All five PO files validate cleanly
with `msgfmt --check`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added
- Initial release of the toolkit: legacy CSV translations for seven apps,
  glossary, AI translator (Anthropic Claude, CSV input), bench-deploy and
  validation scripts.
